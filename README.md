Hello there! Thank you so much for checking out my first personal website :)

I coded this website using only HTML, so that's why it's very ... visually displeasing. But I was brushing up my HTML skills and used Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course to get a nice start! I added my own twist to a lot of the components, like the sections as well as types of inputs in the Contact Me form!

Concepts Used:
- Basics of HTML (headings, paragraphs, bold, italics, breaks)
- Hyperlinking words
- Tables
- Lists
- Forms (labels, input types)
- Adding emojis

(P.S. The contact information is fake; please do NOT contact the address, phone number, or email! I was just practicing tables :D)
(P.P.S. If you really want to contact me, please use the form as it is linked to my personal email account. Thank you!)
